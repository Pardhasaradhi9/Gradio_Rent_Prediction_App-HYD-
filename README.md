# Gradio Application which predicts "House Rent Of Hyderabad"
# App-Link: [HYD_Rent_Predictor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/GastinoKuros/HYD_Rent_Predictor)

## Overview
This is an end to end Machine Learning + Gradio Project, the aim of this project is to use "Regression Models" to predict the house rents of a metro-city of India i.e., "Hyderabad".
I've followed the Machine Learning life-cycle i.e.,
1) Problem Definition 📖
2) Data Collection 📁
3) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing 🧹
4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
5) Feature Engineering and Selection 🧰
6) Model Selection ✔️
7) Model Training 🏃🏻‍♂️
8) Model Evaluation and Tuning 👨‍🔧
9) Model Deployment ☺️

## Things to understand before using the gradio-app
- At present there is no dropdown given for locality, so the user need to type the whole locality name eg. "Gachibowli", "Kukatpally", "Himayath Nagar"
- For furnishing { 0 - >no furnishing || 0.5 -> semi-furnished || 1 -> fully-furnished }
- For Parking { 0 -> no Parking || 1 -> two wheeler || 2 -> 4 wheeler || 3 -> Both are allowed}

## Usage
